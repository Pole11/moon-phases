## General info
I started this little project because it was hard for me to understand how moon phases work, so I decided to visualize them. I am not an astronomer but I know that the animation is not faithful to the reality, but I hope that it will help you to understand a little more how the moon phases work. 

I am not an expert programmer, and probably the way I wrote the code is not the best one in the world, but I am very proud about the final result because I had fun and I learned a lot writing it.

## Technologies
For the animation I used:
* <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>

## Setup
To run this project, you can: 
* click on this <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Pole/full/AotekHRKA">link</a> 
* open it with the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/Pole/sketches/AotekHRKA">web editor</a> of p5.js so that you can also modify the code
* use a live server (if you use VSCode you can use this <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">extension</a>, or you can install <a href="http://brackets.io/">brackets</a> which is a text editor with the live server functionality built in)
* use another method, there are a lot...

## Explanation
If you have some issues understanding what the semicircles you are looking at represent, I will explain in the next lines:
* the biggest yellowish semicirle represent the illuminated half of the earth, the other half is dark, so you can't see it
* the smaller semicircle orbiting around the earth is the moon
* the circle on the right is the view of the moon from the earth, this is the part to look at to see the phases of the moon
